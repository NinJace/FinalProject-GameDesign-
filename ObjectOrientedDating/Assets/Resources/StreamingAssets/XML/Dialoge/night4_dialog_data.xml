    <string>Today sure was a busy day. I think I’m really going to like it here. I keep remembering what Ryn said about choosing a mentor. The teachers here all seem so good, how will I know who’s right for me? Maybe I should just go with the flow until I know who I want.</string>
    <string>I wake up well rested and ready for a new day. I have all my classes on Monday and Wednesday, so today I’m free. I should finish up my homework before the next class. In fact, I bet I could get my professors to check it before tomorrow.</string>
