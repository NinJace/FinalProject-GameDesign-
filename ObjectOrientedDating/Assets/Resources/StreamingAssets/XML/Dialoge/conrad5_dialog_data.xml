    <string>Professor Conrad seemed focused on the computer, a somewhat frustrated look on his face.</string>
    <string>Sorry, [NAME]. I’m trying to run this neural network, but it’s taking longer than I’d like. Did you know that I use Graphics Cards to run my linear algebra calculations?</string>
    <string>No?</string>

    <string>I just finished my homework for you class. I wondering if you could make  sure I did it right.</string>
