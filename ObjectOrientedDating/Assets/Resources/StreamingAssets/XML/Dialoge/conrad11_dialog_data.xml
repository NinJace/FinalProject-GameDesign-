    <string>Start</string>
    <string>You arrive in Conrad’s domain. His office reminds you of every other office you’ve been in. Very office-y.</string>
    <string>Came to ask about homework again?</string>
    <string>Not really. I came to ask about you.</string>
    <string>What about me?</string>

    <string>Well how do you like it here?</string>
    <string>I haven’t been here too long, but it’s a good time. The staff and the other students are really nice.</string>
    <string>How nice?</string>
    <string>Nice, but not too nice that it’s as weird as the question you just asked.</string>
    <string>Oops.</string>

    <string>Well I just happened to find a graphics card lying around.</string>
    <string>That sounds incredibly suspicious. Did you steal that from someone?</string>
    <string>No. I found it.</string>
    <string>That’s not very reassuring.</string>
    <string>He’s totally ruining the mood. How can I fix this? I gotta lay down the smooth moves.</string>

    <string>So... you free tonight?</string>
    <string>TOO SMOOTH. I’m not trying to hit on him. I’m just trying to engage in casual conversation.</string>
    <string>I’ve actually got a very important nap to take. But thanks anyway.</string>
    <string>Wow this could not have gone worse. I might as well have screamed “FAIL ME DADDY.” It’s kind of reassuring that I didn’t, but not really.</string>
    <string>Yeah, I’ll just see you in class later.</string>

    <string>Oh, I really do appreciate the card though.</string>
