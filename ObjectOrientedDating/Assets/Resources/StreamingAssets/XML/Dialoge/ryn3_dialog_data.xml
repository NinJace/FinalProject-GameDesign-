    <string>Soooo, how was your first day? Exciting huh?</string>
    <string>This isn’t my first time at college. Just my first time here.</string>
    <string>[None]Machine Learning</string>
    <string>Yeah. Machine learning sounds like it’s going to be a difficult class. I don’t know much about it, but I really like the teacher.</string>

    <string>The other classes should be good too. I’m just hoping the work won’t overwhelm me. I don’t expect it to.</string>
    <string>If that’s it, I’ve got some work to go back to. See you tomorrow!</string>
    <string> </string>
    <string>[None]VR</string>
    <string>I did a little bit of research on VR in my undergraduate studies, no programing though. I’m just hoping Arun doesn’t make us develop with the headset on.</string>

    <string>[None]Cloud Computing</string>
    <string>I hate to admit this, but I thought the class would have more to do with weather. Don’t laugh at me, and definitely don’t tell Amini.</string>
