    <string>Hey, babe, what’s up?</string>
    <string>Nothing much, just thinking about the Machine Learning Material. I went to Dr. Conrad’s office hours a few times, but I feel like the concepts are just out-of-reach.</string>
    <string>You didn’t learn anything?!</string> 
    <string>Along from Conrad needing a new graphics card, not really.</string>
    <string>Well, let me see what you’ve got so far.</string>
    <string>You and Seth look at your homework.</string>
    <string>Not bad, you seem to be on the right track.</string>
    <string>Do you have any suggestions?</string>
    <string>Machine Learning can be hard, but just have faith in yourself and Conrad. That man once taught a Programming Languages class while recovering from surgery. Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Just keep going to office hours, and here- give him this old graphics card I have laying around. Now go do your thing [NAME]!</string>
