    <string>Arun is supposed to have his office hours today. The door is closed, so I knock.</string>
    <string>Come in!</string>
    <string>The door opens to reveal his office. It’s a small little space. Arun hasn’t done much to the space so it looks just like every other teacher’s office. Could use a little more decoration.</string>
    <string>Came to ask about the class?</string>

    <string>Well yes. More specifically the first assignment.</string>
    <string>Having trouble?</string>
    <string>No, I just want to make sure I did it correctly.</string>
    <string>Oh, well I’d be happy to take a look. Usually I don’t get students coming in this early so I was a little confused. Most of my visitors are worried about failing their classes. It’s nice to have a change.</string>
    <string>I hand Arun my homework. He pulls out his answer key to make sure I have them right.</string>

    <string>These look good, so don’t worry. I’m glad that you got the hang of it pretty quick. Hopefully this means I won’t see you later. You know, failing and all. Have a good day.</string>
    <string>Thanks Arun! I think I’ll be just fine.</string>
    <string>I leave his office and close the door.</string>
