    <string>Finally! The day is over! Time to go play some games!</string>
    <string>Danny notices me enter his room..</string>
    <string>Oh hey there, [NAME]! Did you enjoy the lectures today?</string>
    <string>It was just the first day, but I noticed you were just playing games in there. What gives?</string>
    
    <string>Hey! I may not seem like I’m paying attention, but I am!</string>
    <string>He switches his attention to the game on his computer monitor.</string>
    <string>[None]Amini.</string>
    <string>[None]Arun.</string>
    <string>[None]Conrad.</string>
    
    <string>Yeah. Amini’s a pretty good professor, but cloud computing is interesting in how I can sync my game with the cloud.</string>
    <string>Arun’s classes are pretty fun. I always wanted to do VR, but wearing glasses makes it difficult to do that sort of stuff.</string>
    <string>I’ve never had a class with Conrad before, but I think Machine Learning is useful for creating difficult AI in games.</string>
    <string>Anyway, you might not see me in class that often, but keep me updated on what’s going on!</string>
    <string>I let out a sigh as Danny’s lax nature is revealed to me.</string>
