    <string>Start</string>
    <string>As I knocked on the door, I could hear yelling from the room. I could hear some stumbling in the room and footsteps headed towards the door. Danny opens it to reveal himself.</string>
    <string>Oh! Hello again, [NAME]! I’m just gaming again, but don’t mind me! If I’ve been yelling, then I apologize. I’ve been trying out this new game, Dank Spirits, and it’s been giving me a rough time!</string>
    <string>This early in the morning though?</string>
    <string>Well. Sometimes I wake up early, and once I get all my morning rituals done, I just play some games if I have time before class starts. Is that a problem?</string>

    <string>No, but…</string>
    <string>But what?</string>
    <string>Danny is squinting his eyes at me, curious as to what I’m about to say next. I open my mouth, about to say something, but then I close my mouth and shake my head.</string>
    <string>Sorry. Didn’t mean to be rude, but I get what you mean. Anyway, it’s about time for us to head to class. You go on ahead, I gotta shut down my computer.</string>
    <string>Danny waves me off, and I proceed to walk to Oliver…</string>
