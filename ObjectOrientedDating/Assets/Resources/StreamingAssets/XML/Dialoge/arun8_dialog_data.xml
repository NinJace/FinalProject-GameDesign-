    <string>Class is going well until Arun goes off on a tangent.</string>
    <string>My wife says I don’t have any gardening skills.</string>
    <string>I’m not sure how we got here.</string>
    <string>She thinks I’m the one who keeps killing out potted plants, but it’s her not me.</string>

    <string>If I can just get one plant to live without her involvement, she’ll have to say that it’s not me.</string>
    <string>But she’ll probably blame the dog before she admits defeat.</string>
    <string>I really don’t understand whatever relationship dynamic is happening here, but I do understand what’s actually important in class. That’s gotta count for something right.</string>
   
    <string>Conrad’s class is a lot more normal. He’s big into machine learning, obviously, but also, some functional programming.</string>
    <string>I know this isn’t an easy class, but I’ll tell you what I do whenever I get stuck. I will write out what I want my program to do in functional pseudocode and the translate it over to imperative.</string>
    <string>It’s a great way to avoid side effects and mutations in your code.</string>
    <string>It’s good advice, but I’m not sure how practical it is. Well it works for him at least.</string>

    <string>Amini walks into class… I’ve never noticed it before but, there is something captivating about him. What is it….</string>
    <string>It is something so subtle.... HIS HAIR</string>
    <string>It is layered with just the right amount of grey. He must really take pride in it. That’s like tender loving care levels of hair. </string>
    <string>bla bla… clouds… and… computing</string>
    <string>I’m not getting much from this lecture.. I can’t stop staring at his hair.</string>
    <string>Just gonna keep staring. No one will think I’m creepy. I’m just really into the lecture.</string>
